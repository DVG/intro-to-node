Intro To Node.js
================

Abstract
--------

JavaScript has often been thought of as a toy language, used for tasks like enabling and disabling blink tags on your aunt’s website. While the core language has remained quirky and downright confusing at times, it has spread like a virus from the web throughout the server side and into other aspects of your every day life. We’ll ignore the benefits or drawbacks of using JavaScript powered toasters (http://greylockvc.tumblr.com/post/52167980457/how-a-very-smart-toaster-won-greylock-hackfest-12) for this precompiler and focus instead on server side development with Node.js. 

This precompiler will not advocate the use of Node.js for all types of problems because it is the new hawtness. While it may be hawt, and it may look good on your resume, it is not the best solution for all problems. In this precompiler, we will openly discuss it’s strengths, weaknesses and focus in on the type of applications that make sense for Node.js. Specifically this session will hone in on providing real time, two way communication between web clients and server side applications. If you have ever encountered this scenario, or think you might in the future, you need to take a hard look at leveraging the benefits of Node.js.

A structured curriculum will be used to guide the students through introductory aspects of Node.js up to eventually building a realtime web socket solution that shows off it's true power. This precompiler assumes 0 knowledge of anything Node.js, although you may need a pair partner if you are not very familiar with the JavaScript programming language. Bring a laptop, a friend, and walk away with a life altering experience (or at least a little bit of Node.js knowledge that will help you land a new job).

Workshop Thoughts
-----------------

Exercise?:
- Web enabled log watcher? Shows off streaming, file access, websockets and express? Could have a portion capture to a database?

Things to show:
- Setup (modules, require, overall structure, npm commands)
- Grunt?
- Windows with Cygwin?
- Express.js
- Websockets with Primus & EngineIO?
- File access
- Promises (bluebird?)
- Database access (mongo/postgres)
- Testing with Jasmine, Sandboxed module
